# Beings

Let us introduce you to the concept of **Beings**.  

Since this concept is central to the **AIUS model**, we’ve prepared a **TL;DR** for quick understanding before diving deeper.

**What are Beings?**

- Beings are the foundational elements of all systems and networks, specifically built with AIUS. In simple terms:
    - Beings encompass everything, including events, entities, and relationships within and across systems.
    - `Beings = [Events, Relationships, Entities]`
    - `Beings = [Energy, Relationships, Matter]`
- When designing AIUS, we've attempted to create a framework that would allow building a universal abstraction layer for such cases. Think of it as a LEGO blocks factory:
    - Each block is of a type `Being: Entity` and each instance is unique among that type,
    - Each change made within the system is of a type `Being: Event`. For instance, you can CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) the entities and their types.
    - In order to be able to link events (changes) with the blocks themselves, we need `Being: Relationships`. They glue everything together.
- For Python and Object-Oriented Programming enthusiasts, Beings can be likened to a superclass of all classes and objects in the AIUS model. Analogous to Python's `object` class, the Being class is a subclass of Python's `object`, but introduces abstractions necessary for sentient AI and long-term memory systems.
